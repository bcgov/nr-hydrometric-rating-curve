        Hydrometric field work involves regular visits to a hydrometric gauging station across a range of streamflow conditions. A hydrometric gauging station typically consists of a stage sensor and benchmarks or reference gauge from which water level is referenced. Each field visit should collect three basic observations: reference of stage, measurement of discharge, and control observation. These observations are required to convert stage into discharge through the development of a hydrometric rating curve.  (Note: Safety should be considered when collecting these observations, do not attempt any unsafe field work!). 
        </br><br>The Hydrometric Rating Application (HydRA) is a tool for developing hydrometric rating curves based on observations of stage and discharge.  HydRA allows the user to upload observations of stage and discharge and automatically fits a rating curve.  Users can adjust the fit according to onsite observations. It then generates a rating equation that can be used for converting stage datasets into discharge.
