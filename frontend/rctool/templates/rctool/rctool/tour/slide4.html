        The HydRA app offers the option to auto-fit rating curves by finding the best equation describing the uploaded field data.  The auto-fit function uses a power law model with weights based on discharge measurement uncertainty.  A least square method is used to define the auto-fit, this fit may be optimized by adjusting applicable measurements or offsets.

    <small class='text-description'>
        The uncertainty for each discharge measurement is used to weigh the importance of each measurement in the fit.
        Implementation details of the power law model can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/nr-hydrometric-rating-curve">open source code</a> of HydRA
        and the documentation for the <a href="https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/builtin_models.html#lmfit.models.PowerLawModel" target="_blank">lmfit</a> library and its
